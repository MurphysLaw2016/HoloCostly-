    "The Nazis attempted to either partially or completely dismantle the extermination camps in order to hide "
    "any evidence that people had been murdered there. This was an attempt to conceal not only the extermination "
    "process but also the buried remains. As a result of the secretive Sonderaktion 1005, the camps were dismantled by "
    "commandos of condemned prisoners, their records were destroyed, and the mass graves were dug up. "
    "Some extermination camps that remained uncleared of evidence were liberated by Soviet troops, "
    "who followed different standards of documentation and openness than the Western allies did."
